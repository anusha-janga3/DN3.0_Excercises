Performance Comparison
Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) (when already sorted)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Pros: Simple to implement.
Cons: Inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (can be avoided with good pivot selection)
Pros: Efficient for large datasets with an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
Cons: Requires careful pivot selection to avoid worst-case performance.
Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred
Efficiency: Quick Sort is generally preferred for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it more efficient for large datasets compared to Bubble Sort.
Performance: While both algorithms have quadratic worst-case scenarios, Quick Sortâ€™s worst case is rare and can be mitigated with good pivoting strategies.
Space: Quick Sort can be implemented with in-place partitioning, reducing memory usage compared to Merge Sort.
