Understand Array Representation
Array Representation in Memory
Memory Layout: Arrays in memory are stored in contiguous blocks. This means all elements are placed next to each other in a single continuous block of memory. For example, if an array of integers is declared, the memory locations of the integers are sequential.
Indexing: Arrays provide constant-time access to elements because the memory address of each element can be computed directly from its index. This is done using the formula: address = base_address + (index * element_size).
Advantages:
Constant-Time Access: Accessing any element by its index is O(1) due to direct memory addressing.
Cache Efficiency: Contiguous memory allocation improves cache performance because adjacent elements are likely to be in the same cache line.
Simple Implementation: Arrays are straightforward to implement and use.



Analysis
Time Complexity of Each Operation
Add Employee:

Average Case: O(1) (if there's space in the array)
Worst Case: O(1) (but may require a check if space is available)
Search Employee by ID:

Average Case: O(n) (linear search)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the employee is the last one or not present)
Traverse Employees:

Time Complexity: O(n) (requires visiting each element in the array)
Delete Employee by ID:

Average Case: O(n) (linear search to find the employee and then shifting elements)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the employee is the last one or not present)
Limitations of Arrays
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size upon creation. If more space is needed, a new larger array must be created and copied, which can be inefficient.
Deletion Complexity: Deleting an element requires shifting elements to fill the gap, which is O(n).
Insertion Complexity: Adding an element (if space is available) is O(1), but if the array is full, resizing involves creating a new array and copying elements.
When to Use Arrays
Small to Medium Size Data: Arrays are suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is known and relatively small.
Fixed Size Data: When the size of the dataset does not change frequently.
Performance Sensitivity: When constant-time access and cache efficiency are important.
For scenarios with dynamic sizes or frequent insertions/deletions, consider using data structures like ArrayList in Java, which dynamically resizes and provides more flexibility.
