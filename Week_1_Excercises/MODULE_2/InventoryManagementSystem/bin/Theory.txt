Understanding the Problem
Efficient data storage and retrieval are essential in handling large inventories because:

Scalability: As the number of products grows, the system must be able to handle increased data volume without significant performance degradation.
Performance: Quick access to inventory data is crucial for operations such as checking stock levels, updating quantities, and processing orders.
Consistency: Ensuring data consistency and accuracy is vital for inventory management to avoid discrepancies.
Resource Management: Efficient use of memory and processing power helps in reducing operational costs and improving system reliability.
Types of Data Structures Suitable for Inventory Management

ArrayList:
Advantages: Simple to use, dynamic resizing, fast access by index.
Disadvantages: Slow insertion and deletion in the middle, inefficient for searching unless sorted.

HashMap:
Advantages: Fast access, insertion, and deletion (average O(1) time complexity), keys allow for unique product identification.
Disadvantages: Unordered, potential for hash collisions, uses more memory.

TreeMap:
Advantages: Ordered by keys, allows for range queries, balanced tree structure.
Disadvantages: Slower access, insertion, and deletion compared to HashMap (O(log n) time complexity).


Analysis
Time Complexity

Add Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average due to the underlying hash table structure of HashMap.
Update Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average, as it involves a put operation which is typically O(1).
Delete Product:

Time Complexity: O(1) on average, as it involves a remove operation which is typically O(1)
