Understand Recursive Algorithms
Concept of Recursion
Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It simplifies certain problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
Base Case: The condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself. It provides a simple, non-recursive solution to a problem.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where the recursion happens, breaking the problem into smaller instances.
Example of Recursive Problem: Calculating the factorial of a number, where factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1) with the base case factorial(0) = 1.

Advantages:

Simplicity: Recursive solutions can be simpler and more intuitive than iterative ones.
Divide and Conquer: Allows solving problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems.
Disadvantages:

Performance: Recursive solutions can lead to excessive computation if not optimized properly.
Memory Usage: Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow for deep recursions.

Method to Calculate Future Value Using Recursion
To forecast future values based on past data, you can use recursion to predict the value based on growth rates. Here’s a simple example:

Future Value Calculation:

Formula: 
𝐹𝑉=𝑃𝑉×(1+𝑟)𝑛
FV=PV×(1+r)n
 
𝐹𝑉
FV: Future Value
𝑃𝑉
PV: Present Value
𝑟
r: Growth Rate
𝑛
n: Number of Periods
Recursive Approach:

The recursive function will calculate future values by reducing the number of periods until it reaches zero.

Analysis
Time Complexity
Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm:
The recursive algorithm performs one call per period, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of periods.
Each recursive call involves a constant amount of work (multiplying and reducing the period count).
Optimization to Avoid Excessive Computation
Memoization:

Definition: Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
Implementation: Create a cache (e.g., a map or array) to store previously computed future values.
Tail Recursion:

Definition: A recursive function where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. Some languages can optimize tail-recursive functions to iterative loops.
Implementation: Rewrite the recursive function to use tail recursion, if applicable.
